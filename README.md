# Go implementations of algorithms and methods described in Algorithms Illuminated
In this repository i implement various algorithms and analysis methods from the books and video lectures of Tim Roughgarden's [Algorithms Illuminated](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org).

All credit for the algorithms and methods implemented here goes to Tim (except the mistakes - those are mine). The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my knowledge of algorithms
- Learn Go
